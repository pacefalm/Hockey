Scraping and analysis of data from NHL and other leagues

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need a version of Python3 installed and the core files in each folder to scrape and analyze. Use IPython/Jupyter for best experience. Make sure you have NumPy and matplotlib as well.
Required:

Numpy
Matplotlib

Suggested:

Ipython
Jupyter


### Installing

Run the setup.py. You may wish to do this with in a virtual environment

```
pip install -e .
```

Another easy way to get this all (especially on Windows) is with Anaconda (https://www.continuum.io/downloads--make sure to get a Python3 version).
